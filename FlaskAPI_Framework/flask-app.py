# We are doing 2 things here. We are creating a flask app that is going 
# to have a basic website to show our data. And we are going to render it 
# in the HTML file.

# Building flask app to display our nobel file into index.html 
#  HOW TO BUILD A REST API THAT DOES BASIC CRUD FUNCTIONS

# Json = cuz we will format it in json 
# render_template = cuz we are going to be rendering our data into 
#                   our template called HTML
# request = cuz we are going to accept data in the form of a request
